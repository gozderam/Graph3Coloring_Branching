# Graph3Coloring_Branchin
Implementation of the Branching Algorithm in the graph 3-Coloring Problem.

The algorithm is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0006046.pdf.

All libraries are tested in project `[LibraryName]Tests`
Tests for graphs with more than 600 neighbors are in project `BigTests` (due to XUnit limitations)
